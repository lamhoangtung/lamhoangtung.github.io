                    Hey! I'm a third year Computer Science student in Vietnam, interested in AI and machine learning. I
                    like to build things, but if you're lucky you might even find me making something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm best known for my Kaggle results where I am ranked in the top 50 data scientists worldwide, but
                    I often
                    delve into other hobbies such as music, game development and building overpowered computers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m currently conducting research into various areas of machine learning, computer vision and
                    artificial
                    intelligence. You can see all my publications here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best way to contact me is usually through email.
                </p>
