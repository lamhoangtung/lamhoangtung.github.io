            <p>
                Hey! I'm a high school student in the UK, interested in machine learning, hardware, virtual reality, netsec
                and cryptocurrencies. I like to break things, but if you're lucky you might even find me making something.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm best known for my Kaggle results where I am ranked in the top 50 data scientists worldwide, but I often
                delve into other hobbies such as music, game development and building overpowered computers.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I’m currently conducting research into various areas of machine learning, computer vision and artificial
                intelligence. You can see all my publications here.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The best way to contact me is usually through email.
